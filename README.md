<h3 align="left">About me:</h3>

<br>
<p>Hello! I'm Ozgur ðŸ‘‹.

I am an engineer and data analyst with 14 years of experience in academia and the upstream oil and gas industry in both the United States and Turkey. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering at Penn State University. My research focuses on geological COâ‚‚ storage, geothermal energy, and oil and gas resource assessments through basin-scale geological and thermal modeling. Through this Ph.D. program, I also had the opportunity to work as a research intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I conducted a techno-economic assessment of optimal COâ‚‚ transportation strategies to support large-scale CCUS deployment in northwest Colorado and central Utah.

Previously, I earned an M.Sc. degree from Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering Department of the Penn State University in the U.S. in 2014 with a master's thesis from which I produced 2 peer-reviewed journal articles about petrophysics, shale, geomechanics, and stimulation subjects. After graduation from Penn State, I started working in Turkish Petroleum (TPAO) as a geologist and petrophysicist in 2015. I have 8-year industrial experience in TPAO. 

I also earned my first Ph.D. degree in the Geological Engineering Department of METU in March 2022 where I earned B.Sc. degree in 2011. My Ph.D. thesis includes applications in stratigraphy, sedimentology, petrophysics, and organic geochemistry to investigate petroleum potential of mudstones of Late Cretaceous Haymana Formation in the Haymana Basin, Turkey. This project produced one peer-reviewed journal article in Journal of Petroleum Geoscience.

Shortly after graduation from METU, I decided to improve my programming fundamentals and completed 9-week Ironhack Data Analytics program. I learned new skills for my current job and potential data analyst position such as Machine Learning, Python, MySQL, Data Visualization, API, Web Scraping, and Inferential Statistics. I used these skills in 7 different projects such as Spotify song recommender, weather predictions, and football match predictions.

I look forward to new opportunities in the oil and gas, carbon storage, geothermal, and tech industries. Feel free to contact me for any questions and comments via ltaylanozgur@gmail.com.
