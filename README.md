<h3 align="left">About me:</h3>

<br>
<p>Hello! I'm Ozgur ðŸ‘‹.

I am an engineer and a data analyst from Ankara, Turkey, and an alumni of Middle East Technical University (METU) where I earned my B.Sc. degree in Geological Engineering Department in 2011. Then, I graduated from Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering Department of the Penn State University in the U.S. in 2014 with a master's thesis from which I produced 3 articles about petrophysics, shale, geomechanics, and stimulation subjects.

After graduation from Penn State, I started working in Turkish Petroleum (TPAO) as a geologist and petrophysicist in 2015. I have 8-year industrial experience in TPAO. Moreover, I earned a Ph.D. degree in the Geological Engineering Department of METU in March 2022. My thesis includes applications in stratigraphy, sedimentology, petrophysics, and organic geochemistry to investigate petroleum potential of mudstones of late Cretaceous Haymana Formation in the Haymana Basin, Turkey.

Shortly after graduation, I decided to improve my programming fundamentals and completed 9-week Ironhack Data Analytics program. I learned new skills for my current job and potential data analyst position such as Machine Learning, Python, MySQL, Data Visualization, API & Web Scraping, and Inferential Statistics. I used these skills in 7 different projects such as Spotify song recommender, weather predictions, and football match predictions. 
 
My goal is to enhance my knowledge and improve my skills. I look forward to new opportunities. Feel free to contact me for any questions and comments via ltaylanozgur@gmail.com.</p>
